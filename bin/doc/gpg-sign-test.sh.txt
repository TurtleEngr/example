  Test Outline
    *   If ~/.cache/gpg-sign-test (with the test sample files) is not found
        then it will be created by this script. Also a test gpg homedir and
        test key will be created.

        To be sure everything is up-to-date with the tests, you can remove
        all of ~/.cache/gpg-sign-test so it will be rebuilt.
