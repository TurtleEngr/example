* example
- This repository is used for example code that is referenced by
  various articles I have written.

- Why not use github's gists? The long hash codes in the URL them hard
  to rember and use.

** Organization
+ Develop branch is only used for some mainenance scripts.
+ Branches are used to categorize the code that is referenced by
  articles.  Think of branches as separate repository.
+ The branches are never merged back to develop.
+ New branches are created from the develop branch.
