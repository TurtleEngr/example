* example
- This repository is used for example code that is referenced by
  various articles I have written.

- Why not use github's gists? The long hash codes in the URL them hard
  to rember and use.

** Organization
+ develop branch is only used for some mainenance scripts.
+ Branches are used to categorize code that is referenced by articles.
  Think of branches as separate repos.q
+ The branches are never merged back to develop.
+ develop can be merged to any branch, but not if the branch replaces
  files that are on develop.
